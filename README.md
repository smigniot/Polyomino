# Polyomino

A [polyomino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino) generic solver. 
This project began as a basic [Pentomino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino) 10x6 solver.
It evolved to :

* Compute the shape set for any Cardinality - For Pentominos, cardinality=5
* Compute all solutions for a Width x Height board, for shapes of Cardinality
